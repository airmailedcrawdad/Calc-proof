# Formal Definition of the Collapse Coordinate System (CCS)

## Definition
Let |ψ⟩ be a probabilistic origin in Hilbert space,  
and let {eᵢ} be a finite set of orthogonal axes representing collapse outcomes.  

Define the **Collapse Coordinate System (CCS)** by:

1. **Metric:**  
   d(ψ, eᵢ) = || |ψ⟩ − |eᵢ⟩ ||

2. **Collapse Event:**  
   C(|ψ⟩) = argminᵢ d(ψ, eᵢ)  
   (nearest axis by distance)

3. **Probabilistic Weighting:**  
   If multiple axes are equidistant, assign probabilities proportional to alignment:

   P(eᵢ | ψ) ∝ ⟨ψ|eᵢ⟩²

---

## Theorem 1 (Reduction to Classical Projection)
If |ψ⟩ already lies on an axis eᵢ, then:

C(|ψ⟩) = eᵢ

**Proof.**  
Since d(ψ, eᵢ) = 0 and d(ψ, eⱼ) > 0 for j ≠ i, the argmin is unique.  
Thus CCS collapses exactly to the classical projection outcome. ✅

---

## Theorem 2 (Resolution of Undefined States)
If |ψ⟩ corresponds to an undefined point (e.g., asymptote or singularity),  
then CCS reinterprets it as a probabilistic origin with projection to nearest axis.

**Proof (Case analysis).**  
- If |ψ⟩ lies equidistant from two axes, CCS assigns both as possible outcomes with weights.  
- If |ψ⟩ diverges (||ψ|| → ∞), CCS normalizes |ψ⟩ to unit sphere and still resolves a nearest axis.  
- Therefore, every undefined state resolves to a structured collapse outcome. ✅

## Example 1: Rational Singularity
f(x) = 1/x at x=0.  
- Map left-approach to axis e₁.  
- Map right-approach to axis e₂.  
- CCS outcome = {e₁, e₂}, symmetric resolution possible.

---

## Example 2: Distributional Collapse
f(x) = 1/x² around 0.  
- Classically diverges.  
- In CCS, |ψ⟩ diverges but normalizes to a direction axis, producing δ(0) distribution.  

---

## Interpretation
- CCS reframes undefined points as probabilistic origins.  
- Collapse outcomes correspond to **nearest axes**.  
- Recursive dives into new CCS frames yield strange-loop behavior and higher-order structure.

# Formal Proof of the Collapse Resolution Operator

## Definition
Let f: ℝ → ℝ ∪ {±∞, undefined}.  
The **Collapse Resolution Operator** at point a ∈ ℝ is defined:

C[f](a) = lim (x→a) f(x)  if the limit exists in ℝ.  

If not, assign:

C[f](a) = { lim (x→a⁻) f(x), lim (x→a⁺) f(x) }

with **symmetric resolution**:

Cs[f](a) = ½ ( lim (x→a⁻) f(x) + lim (x→a⁺) f(x) )

If both diverge, collapse is defined in the sense of distributions (e.g., Dirac delta).

---

## Theorem 1 (Extension of Classical Calculus)
For all f continuous at a:

C[f](a) = f(a).

**Proof.**  
If the limit exists and equals f(a), then by definition C reduces to the classical case.  
Thus, C is an extension, not a contradiction, of standard calculus. ✅

---

## Theorem 2 (Resolution of Singularities)
If f has a singularity at a, then C[f](a) yields a structured set of outcomes (left limit, right limit, or symmetric distribution).

**Proof (Case analysis).**  
- If lim (x→a⁻) f(x) = L⁻ ∈ ℝ and lim (x→a⁺) f(x) = L⁺ ∈ ℝ, then  
  C[f](a) = { L⁻, L⁺ }.  
- If one-sided limits diverge, collapse returns those as outcomes.  
- If both diverge symmetrically, collapse yields a distributional assignment (e.g., 1/x → Dirac delta under integration).  
Therefore, no point remains “undefined.” ✅

---

## Examples
1. f(x) = 1/x at a=0  
   C  = { −∞, +∞ }, Cs  = 0.  

2. ∫ from −1 to 1 (1/x) dx  
   Classically divergent. Collapse symmetry defines it as 0.  

3. f(x) = 1/x² around 0  
   Integral diverges. Collapse assigns δ(0), consistent with distribution theory.
